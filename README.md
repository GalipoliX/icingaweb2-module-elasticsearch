Icingaweb2 Logstash Integration
===============================

This is a very early test module for Icingaweb2, offering Logstash Event integration.

It is planned to have the following features:
* Event search/display in the web interface
* CLI check command for Icinga(2)
* Integration into service details
* Search configuration coming from icinga2 service.vars

## Disclaimer

Be WARNED, this module is not yet tested against big Elasticsearch installations, it might cause problems there.

Neither is this module currently supported by anyone, use at your own risk.
